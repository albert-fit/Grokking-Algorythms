    "## How memory works\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you need store some cash in a security box in a bank. You ask for two boxes and the teller lets you know which ones you can use. This is basically how your computer's memory works. The computer looks like a giant set of security boxes, and each box has an address - such as fe0ffeeb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time you want to store an item in memory, you ask your computer for some space and it returns an address where you can store the item.\n",

    " - arrays;\n",
    " - linked lists.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Arrays and linked lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are writing an app to manage the pizza orders. You'll want to store each pizza order in memory. For now let's assume that all that gets stored is the name of the pizza.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you use an array or a linked list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an array means that all your tasks are stored contiguously(right next to each other) in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose you have three orders (and their corresponding cash) and you would like to add them to the security boxes. But the next box is taken up by someone else's stuff!\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like going to a pizza place with your friends and you need a table, but another friend joins you, and there is no place for them. You have to move to a new spot where you all fit. In this case you ask the computer for a different chunk of memory so you can fit four tasks. Then you need to move all your tasks there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If another friend comes by, you are out of room again, and you'll have to move a second time! Similarly, adding new items to an array can be a pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy fix is to \"hold seats\": even if you have only three items in your tasks lists, you can ask your computer for ten items. Then you can add up to 10 items without having to move. A couple of downsides:\n",
    " - You may not need the extra slots you asked for, and then that memory will be wasted.\n",
    " - You may add more than 10 items to the list and have to move anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "With linked lists, items can be moved anywhere into memory. Each item stores the address of the next item in the list. A bunch of random memory addresses are linked together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit like a treasure hunt, you go to the first item and it says: \" The next item can be found at adress 123 \".\n",
    "You go to address 123 and it says: \"The next item can be found at address 456.\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "With linked lists you never have to move your items and you also avoid another problem. Let's say you show up at the pizza place with your friend and the place is packed. There are'nt 6 seats together. Sometimes this happens with arrays. Let's say you are trying to find 10,000 slots for your arrays. Your memory has 10,000 slots but not all together. A linked lists is like saying \"Let's split up and eat some pizza.\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's space in your memory, there is space for your linked list.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you need to read the last item in a linked list. You can't simply go to the last item because you won't have the address. You have to go to the first item, then the second and so on. Linked lists are great if you're going to read all the items one at the time. But if you are going to keep jumping all  the time, linked lists are terrible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are different. You know the address of each item in your array. This makes them great if you want to read random elements because you can look up any element in your array instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a linked list you can't calculate the position of the fifth element in memory - you have to go to the first element, to get the address of the second element, then go to the second element and so on.\n",

    "## Excercise\n",
    "Suppose you're building an app to keep track of your finances. Every day, you write down everything you spent money on. At the end of the month, you review your expenses and sum up how much you spend. So you have lots of inserts and a few reads. Should you use an array or a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inserting into the middle of a list\n",
    "\n",
    "What's better if you want to insert elements in the middle: arrays or lists? With lists, it's as easy as changing what the previous element points to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For arrays you have to shift all the rest of the elements down.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no space, you might have to copy everything to a new location! Lists are better if you want to insert elements into the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the run times for operations on arrays and lists:\n",
    "            arrays | lists\n",
    "reading     O(1)   | O(n)\n",

    "\n",
    "O(n)= linear time\n",
    "O(1)= constant time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "With each item in your linked list, you use a little bit of memory to store the address of the next item. This is called a pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointers come up sometimes, especially if you write with a low level language like C.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deletions\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you want to delete an element? Again, lists are better because you just need to change what the previous element points to.\n",
    "\n",
    "With arrays, everything needs to be moved up when you delete an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike insertions, deletions will always work. Insertions can fail if there is no space in the memory, but you can always delete an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some run times for common operations on arrays and linked lists:\n",
    "            arrays | lists\n",
    "reading     O(1)   | O(n)\n",
    "insertion   O(n)   | O(1)\n",
    "deletion    O(n)   | O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth mentioning that insertions and deletions are O(1) time only if you can instantly access the element to be deleted. It is common practice to keep track of the first and last items in a linked list, so it would only take O(1) time to delete those.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which is used more often, arrays or linked lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are often used because they have a lot of advantages over linked lists, such as being better at read and providing random access.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of access: \n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential access - reading elements one by one, starting with the first element - linked lists\n",
    "Random access - jump directly to the desired element - arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are also faster because they can use caching. Computers read a whole section at a time because that makes it a lot faster to go to the next item.\n",
    "You can do caching with arrays but no with lists, because with lists you need to read each item at the time to find out where the next one is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are better for reads. What about memory efficiency?\n",
